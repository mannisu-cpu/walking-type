    <h3>
        The verb ‘to walk’ owes its etymological origin to the Middle Dutch verb walken, <br>
        which means to knead, to press, or to full. These activities seem very logical and timely, <br>
        because what else are we doing to the earth or in between sidewalk breaks? <br>
        By the weight of our bodies and with the help of gravity we push the matter under us. <br>
        We knead, imprint, trample, and leave traces, whether we want to or not. Additionally, <br>
        we press any thing deeper, beneath our feet, e.g. seeds, environmental fossils or broken artefacts. <br>
        We leave our footprints on top of each other, laying down matter. <br>
        When we shift our focus to the horizontal encounters on the ground, <br>
        we have a chance to look at our surroundings from a frog’s perspective. <br>
        We see layers of before invisible bodies, already left behind, <br>
        brought by someone from another continent or from the next-door apartment. <br>
        From this perspective, wandering becomes an act of intuitive networking between found traces and a drift between
        places and imagination to reach new speculative relations.
